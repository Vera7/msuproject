	<h2>Graduation and Dropout Statistics</h2>

	<p>
		Education is a very important factor that can help improve and enhance numerous lives. Within our society and communities, we have great number of young individuals who are dropping out of high school for various reasons. This unfortunate event tends to have a long lasting impact on their lives, lowering the amount of opportunities available to them, and possibly lowering the quality of life they can have in the future. In my opinion, having the statistics to how many individuals are dropping out of high school is not enough. We need to start focusing on other variables related to why individuals are dropping out of high school. With this information, we can begin the process of determining possible root causes of this unfavorable decision and if possible start providing guidance, help, or information to the affected students or families. This process can begin here.
